        <p>Freelancer Fees and Charges
            For Employers
            Projects
            Freelancer is free to sign up, post a project, receive bids from freelancers, review the freelancer's
            portfolio and discuss the project requirements. If you choose to award the project, we charge you a small
            project fee relative to the value of the selected bid, as an introduction fee.

            The cost and how this fee is charged depends on the type of project.

            For fixed price projects, a fee of 3% or $3.00 USD (whichever is greater) is levied at the time a project
            has been awarded by you. If you subsequently pay the freelancer more than the original bid amount we will
            also charge the project fee on any overage payments.

            For hourly projects, a fee of 3% is levied on each payment that you make to the freelancer.

            You may cancel the project from your dashboard at any time for up to seven (7) days after the project has
            been accepted for a full refund of your fee.

            Optional project upgrades may be purchased.

            Contests
            At the time of posting a contest, employers must provide funds equivalent to the total contest prize. We
            have a Money Back Guarantee for this prize money.

            The Money Back Guarantee entitles you to get your money back for up to 30 days from contest closing if you
            are not happy with the submitted entries. You can get refunded simply by contacting support.

            Note that refunds are not available on 'Guaranteed contests', and this refund does not include any upgrades
            that you may have selected for the contest. If you've already selected an entry as the winner and completed
            the contest handover, which has released the prize money to them, you are not eligible for a refund.

            There is no contest fee for posting and awarding the contest for employers.

            Each additional awarded entry will also require payment of the prize for that entry.

            Optional contest upgrades may be purchased.

            Services
            At the time of ordering a service, employers must provide funds equivalent to the total service price. The
            payment is protected by the Freelancer Milestone Payment System. Only release the payment once you are 100%
            happy with the work that has been delivered.

            For Freelancers
            Freelancer is free to sign up, create a profile, select skills of projects you are interested in, upload a
            portfolio, receive project notifications, discuss project details with the employer, bid on projects (free
            members receive initially 6 bids per month) and enter contests.

            Optional bid upgrades may be purchased to promote a bid.

            Projects
            For fixed price projects, if you are awarded a project, and you accept, we charge you a small project fee
            relative to the value of the selected bid, as an introduction fee. If you are subsequently paid more than
            the original bid amount, we will also charge the project fee on any overage payments.

            For hourly projects, the fee is levied on each payment as it is made by the employer to you.

            The fee for fixed price projects is 10% or $5.00 USD, whichever is greater, and 10% for hourly projects.

            Contests
            Submitting entries to a contest is free. Contest fee applies when you are awarded a contest prize. This fee
            is charged when the prize is released, which is after contest has been awarded to you and the handover of
            entry materials has been completed to the contest poster's satisfaction.

            The freelancer contest fee is 10% or $5.00 USD, whichever is greater.
            Services
            If you are subsequently hired to perform that Service, a 20% fee of the total service price is charged. This
            is charged when the service is ordered by way of a deduction from the payment you receive.

            Preferred Freelancer Program
            If you are in the Preferred Freelancer Program, you will be charged 15% project fee when you are awarded and
            accept a Recruiter project. This will not be charged upfront, like on regular projects, but rather when you
            receive the payment.

            Refunds as Bonus Credit
            In some instances, refund of fees may be done as bonus credit. This bonus may only be used on site, and can
            not be withdrawn or transferred. The bonus will expire in 90 days from the date of receipt.

            0% Fees Promotion
            Freelancer project commissions charged for freelancers who refer new employers that do not have an existing
            account on Freelancer.com and who join and create a new account, will be reduced from 10% to 0%, for all
            future projects performed by the referring freelancer for the referred employer.

            This is subject to the following conditions:

            New employers must be referred using the specific promotional links on
            https://www.freelancer.com/no-commission.
            For the avoidance of doubt, the reduced freelancer project commission of 0% applies only in relation to new
            work performed by the freelancer who has successfully applied for this promotion for the specific employer
            to whom the application relates. The new projects must commence after the employer creates a new account on
            Freelancer.com and be initiated using that new account.
            Project commission fees for the freelancer only are lowered from 10% to 0% under this promotion. All other
            fees and charges remain unaffected including but not limited to employer commissions and transaction fees.
            This promotion does not apply to contests.
            Freelancer reserves the right to review classifications of employers as new employers for the purpose of
            this promotion, to ensure fair use of this promotion. Employers must have worked with, and paid, the
            freelancer applying to use this promotion before the beginning of this promotion, for example from another
            platform. Freelancers may be required to provide evidence of this prior work and payment before being
            eligible for the commission reduction. To be eligible for this promotion, employers must not have had any
            active account on Freelancer.com from which a payment was made within the 6 months immediately prior to
            creating the new account.
            All other elements of the User Agreement continue to apply - see https://www.freelancer.com/about/terms.
            All other elements of the Fees and Charges component of the Additional Terms continue to apply - see
            https://www.freelancer.com/feesandcharges.
            Freelancer may require that both parties fill in and complete their profiles and/or pass identity checks
            before payments are released.
            Freelancer may require that the details for any project for which the commission reduction applies are
            appropriately complete.
            This promotion may be withdrawn for a specific user, if significant reversals, fraud or chargebacks are
            observed, if Freelancer believes that there is a risk of funds being subject to reversal or chargeback, in
            cases of disputes between employer and freelancer, or for any other reason.
            Freelancer reserves the right to disallow use of this promotion in its sole and absolute discretion, with
            respect to fair use of this promotion, and to prevent any suspected fraud.
            Freelancer reserves the right to require submission of further information from any party applying to make
            use of this promotion, for investigating fraud and for risk management and related purposes.
            Freelancer reserves the right to cancel or amend this promotion at any time.
            Freelancer reserves the right to cancel the promotion in any region if it is deemed or becomes unlawful to
            offer the promotion to any resident of that region.
            3% Quote Fee
            Freelancer project commissions charged for freelancers who have a quote awarded by a new external Client
            will be 3% for all projects between the Freelancer and new Client. For new external Clients accepting a
            quote, 0% Freelancer project commissions will be charged.

            "New Client" refers to clients that have not created an account on Freelancer.com before.
            The promotion does not apply if clients have multiple accounts on Freelancer.com.
            This is subject to the following conditions:

            New employers must be referred through accepting a quote and registering during the acceptance process.
            For the avoidance of doubt, the reduced freelancer project commission of 3% applies only in relation to work
            performed by the freelancer who has successfully applied for this promotion for the specific employer to
            whom the application relates. Work must commence after the employer creates a new account on Freelancer.com
            and be initiated using that new account.
            Project commission fees for the freelancer only are lowered from 10% to 3% and client project commission
            fees are lowered from 3% to 0% under this promotion. All other fees and charges remain unaffected including
            but not limited to transaction fees.
            This promotion does not apply to contests.

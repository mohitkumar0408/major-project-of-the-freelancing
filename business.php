                <p>
                    Every business is a system with an external environment. A business manager has to both steer
                    internal processes and respond to that external environment. Consequently, you need services that
                    facilitate your performance as a manager or business owner, such as virtual assistants and business,
                    financial, and HR consulting. Furthermore, your business interacts with a wide range of external
                    parties: customers, business partners, competitors, and legal authorities. For business success, you
                    need to get to know your competitors by conducting market research. When you have a proposal to
                    make, you need an excellent business plan and presentation to convince your business partners and
                    stakeholders. Supply chain management, sales services, and customer care can all help you to deliver
                    a brilliant product and keep your customers satisfied. Last but not least, having a legal consultant
                    on your side is a must to protect your business.

                </p>

            <button class="accordion">

                What business services do I need for my day-today business tasks?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>

                    First of all, your business needs to sell to generate revenue. Thus, you need sales services to help
                    you acquire new customers. In addition, customer care services are critical for keeping existing
                    clients loyal and convincing them to buy again. If you offer physical goods, you will probably also
                    benefit from supply chain management services. For an online shop, you may want to consider
                    e-commerce management to take care of any technical issues and marketing best practices. When your
                    business grows, there are two major implications. First, you need someone to whom you can delegate
                    daily routine management duties and assist with miscellaneous time-consuming tasks. You can hire
                    project management and virtual assistant service providers who will work with you hand-in-hand to
                    keep your business on the upright curve.

            <button class="accordion">

                What business services do I need for long-term planning?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>

                    Every business needs a long-term strategy. It starts with market research that helps you to identify
                    attractive niches. Already at this stage, but especially during the consequent planning phase, you
                    should consider business consulting and financial consulting services. Moreover, once you have a
                    strategy, you can hire business plan and business presentation service providers to turn your
                    freshly backed strategy into a roadmap. You also need these services for good visualization of your
                    business idea and its proof of concept when negotiating with your business investors. Optionally,
                    you may need to hire legal services to create a legal framework for your business idea. HR
                    consulting services will help you to articulate your personnel needs and form a robust recruitment
                    strategy.

            <button class="accordion">

                What is the difference between financial consulting and business consulting?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Business consulting is a broader term and can optionally include financial consulting. A business
                    consultant can guide your business venture from the earliest planning and development stages,
                    helping you to shape your ideas, bring them to paper, and, if necessary, keep realizing them on a
                    routine basis. Alternatively, a business consultant may intervene in a specific business that is
                    experiencing problems, helping to define and implement a stabilization strategy. A financial
                    consultant will help in the same way, but with a specific focus on the financial aspects of your

                    To get results that meet your highest expectations, it is essential to communicate your expectations
                    clearly. Be prepared to describe the scope of work, the final result, and why you need it, and
                    provide a reasonable deadline. It will also help sellers understand what result will work best for
                    you if you disclose some background information about your business and product and, optionally,
                    about how you want to reuse the result--for example, who the target audience of your business is.
                    Sellers also often specify what they need to see from clients in a briefing. Read this section in
                    the offer carefully and follow all instructions as thoroughly as you can.
